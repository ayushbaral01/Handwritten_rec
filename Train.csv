In turning over the bones Doris Langley Moore has brought to light a great deal of discreditable behaviour and a vision of mischief-making propensities of the leisured classes in the early 19th century which leaves one a little breathless."

It has been produced and directed by Mr. Tony Richardson, who is also part-author with Miss Delaney of the script, and the great advantages to be derived from this unity of conception and control are everywhere apparent."

He does not want the accuracy of a police photograph, but rather he wants to show the eternal in every instant."" The chilling horror of ""Malachias"" is due as much to Wicki the photographer as to Wicki the director. His earlier film, ""Die Bru'cke, was equally terrifying, but here the director moves out of the world of reality into an icy supernatural vacuum"

Wicki suddenly returns to the city for a final epilogue. In complete silence he shows the faces of people walking in the streets, smug, content, satisfied, and thoroughly frightening. Wicki has succeeded in his second film in recording his personal apocalypse of the last days of a sick society."
/content/Handwritten_rec/Train/c02-078.png,"It has a great look of speed and technical fun about it, of enormous cinematic enjoy- ment, and above all of cinematic sense. Much of it has that air of improvisation, as of off-the-cuff living, that once seemed so new and so attractive. The story (not that the story, in the sense of plot, matters much; but in the sense of situation and movement it matters a lot) is that of a man on the run (Jean-Paul Belmondo), who spends a few days with an American girl"
/content/Handwritten_rec/Train/c01-014.png,"The libretto, by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is largely a satire on the petty court surrounding an ageing poet, whose deeply egocentric character leads him to sacrifice everything to his need of inspiration. Henze obtains his musical characteri- sation by means of individual instrumental timbres andpersonal"" intervals, and the result is often less delineation of character than caricature. This is also the chief, or at least the most successfully executed trait of the libretto, which contains an odd blend of highly poetic phraseology and schoolboy humour. "

/content/Handwritten_rec/Train/c02-026.png,"A summary of the story can give almost no indication of the scope of Wicki's artistry. He tells his story best in the faces of his crowds, recording every wrinkle and drop of sweat with brutal honesty, building up to a tremendous climax in the island orgy. Here, the guests arrive in ghost-like yachts, the wildly flapping white sails slashed by the glaring beacon of a lighthouse."

Father Malachias goes to the island, prays, and in a second miracle the night club is replaced in its original setting."

An exhibition of these works which is now on view in a Berlin gallery is. most impressive. As Friedrich Du'rrenmatt, the Swiss playwright and author, wrote. Wicki's blacks and greys are not only the colours of the lost and the forgotten, but. they are also the technical means of abstraction."

Both the Antonioni and Wicki films took high honours, and the audience at the awards was particularly enthusiastic when one Miss Anna Kerima was selected as best actress for her work in the Godard film. Gifted with an interesting face, although little acting ability, she would seem to be well worth watching in the months to come."

From a brilliantly funny start, the work fizzles out into a series of repetitious sight-gags and personal jokes incomprehensible to the uninitiated (includ- ing four plugs for Charles Aznavour)."
